# SMTP Submission Module

Lets any SMTP-capable application send **through** BunMail by pointing its SMTP settings at BunMail and authenticating with a BunMail API key. This is what makes BunMail a drop-in replacement for SendGrid/Brevo/Mailgun **SMTP relays** — switch an app to BunMail by changing SMTP credentials only, no code changes.

Introduced in #120.

## Submission vs. inbound — two different SMTP servers

BunMail runs (up to) two independent SMTP listeners. They are **not** the same thing:

| | **Submission** (this module) | **Inbound** ([docs/inbound.md](inbound.md)) |
|---|---|---|
| Direction | Apps send **out** through BunMail | BunMail **receives** mail for your domains |
| Default port | `465` (SMTPS, implicit TLS); `587` plaintext for trusted networks only | `25` (prod) / `2525` (dev) |
| `AUTH` | **Required** (API key) | Disabled |
| Recipient domains | **Any** (it's a relay for authenticated clients) | Only registered domains (open-relay guard) |
| What it does | Parses the message → `createEmail` → outbound queue → DKIM → direct-to-MX | Parses → stores in `inbound_emails` (+ bounce/DMARC branching) |
| Env toggle | `SMTP_SUBMISSION_ENABLED` | `SMTP_ENABLED` |

The open-relay guard for submission is **authentication**: only clients holding a valid API key can send, and they can send to any recipient (that's the point). The inbound receiver, being unauthenticated, instead restricts recipients to your registered domains.

## How apps authenticate

Point the app's SMTP settings at BunMail:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | your BunMail host (e.g. `mail.yourdomain.com`, or `localhost` on the same box) |
| **Port** | `465` (`SMTP_SUBMISSION_TLS_PORT`, SSL/TLS) — or `587` plaintext on a trusted private network |
| **Encryption** | SSL/TLS (implicit) on 465. STARTTLS is **not** offered on 587: the socket upgrade `smtp-server` performs is not implemented by Bun. |
| **Username** | anything — `apikey` is conventional (mirrors SendGrid) |
| **Password** | a BunMail API key, `bm_live_…` |
| **From** | an address on a domain **registered + DKIM-verified** in BunMail |

The password is treated as the API key: SHA-256 hashed and looked up exactly like a REST `Authorization: Bearer` token. The username is ignored (any value works) so apps that force a non-empty username still work.

> **Sender domain requirement.** In `BUNMAIL_ENV=production`, the `From` domain must be registered in BunMail (`POST /api/v1/domains`) or the send is rejected with SMTP `550`. In development, unregistered domains are allowed (sent unsigned). This is the same rule the REST `POST /api/v1/emails/send` path enforces.

## What gets relayed

The submitted message is parsed and mapped to the same fields the REST send API accepts, then handed to `createEmail` — so it flows through the identical queue, retry, DKIM-signing, suppression, and webhook machinery as an API send.

- **From / To / Cc / Subject / HTML / Text** — mapped from the message.
- **BCC** — envelope recipients (`RCPT TO`) that don't appear in the visible `To`/`Cc` headers are treated as blind recipients: delivered, but never rendered in the message headers.

### Not forwarded (v1 limitations)

- **Attachments and arbitrary custom headers** are **not** relayed for **API-key** sessions: the outbound pipeline rebuilds the message from `from/to/cc/bcc/subject/html/text`. Fine for typical transactional mail (Infisical/Netbird/Dify invites, alerts, password resets). **Mailbox** sessions (`user@domain` + mailbox password, see [docs/mailboxes.md](mailboxes.md)) are relayed faithfully instead — the original message is stored in `emails.raw_message` and sent as-is with DKIM, keeping attachments and threading headers.

## Configuration

| Env Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_ENABLED` | `false` | Start the submission server. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_PORT` | `587` | Plaintext listen port (AUTH only with `SMTP_SUBMISSION_ALLOW_INSECURE=true`). |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_TLS_PORT` | `465` | Implicit-TLS (SMTPS) listen port, opened when a cert is configured. `0` disables. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_DAILY_QUOTA` | `0` | Per-API-key messages accepted per UTC day; over-quota → SMTP `452`. `0` = unlimited. See [Quotas](#per-key-daily-quotas-123). |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_TLS_CERT` | _(empty)_ | PEM cert path. When set with the key, the SMTPS listener is opened. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_TLS_KEY` | _(empty)_ | PEM private-key path. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_ALLOW_INSECURE` | `false` | Allow AUTH over plaintext (no TLS). The password is a full-privilege key, so this exposes it to link sniffers. With neither TLS nor this flag the server **refuses to start**. Set `true` only on a trusted network. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Per-IP connection rate limiting. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `30` | Max connections per IP per window. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | `60` | Connection window (seconds). |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Per-IP failed-AUTH throttle (anti key-brute-force). |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `10` | Failed AUTHs per IP before lockout. |
| `SMTP_SUBMISSION_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | `900` | Failed-AUTH window (seconds). |

### TLS / security posture

- **With a cert** (`SMTP_SUBMISSION_TLS_CERT` + `_KEY`): an implicit-TLS listener (SMTPS, `SMTP_SUBMISSION_TLS_PORT`, default 465) is opened so clients AUTH over TLS. This is the recommended posture whenever the port isn't strictly loopback. STARTTLS on 587 is not available under Bun (`smtp-server` upgrades sockets with `tls.TLSSocket`, which Bun doesn't implement) — the 587 listener never advertises it.
- **Without a cert**: plaintext `AUTH` is **refused by default** (#133) — the server won't start, because the API key would travel in the clear. To run plaintext on a **trusted network** (app + BunMail sharing a host or a private Docker network), opt in explicitly with `SMTP_SUBMISSION_ALLOW_INSECURE=true`. Never expose a plaintext submission port to the public internet.
- **Failed-AUTH throttle**: because the password is an API key, repeated failed AUTHs from one IP are counted and locked out (`454`) to blunt key brute-forcing. A successful AUTH clears the counter.

### First-boot checklist (Docker Compose)

Submission is **off by default**. To enable it:

1. **`.env`**: set `SMTP_SUBMISSION_ENABLED=true` (and, for TLS, the cert/key paths).
2. **`docker-compose.yml`**: port 465 is published by default (the acme sidecar provides the cert); 587 stays private unless you uncomment it for a trusted network.
3. **Firewall**: allow inbound TCP on 465 from the networks your apps live on.

Then `docker compose up -d --build`. When submission is off, the app logs `SMTP submission server disabled — set SMTP_SUBMISSION_ENABLED=true …` at startup.

## Integration examples

### NestJS (`@nestjs-modules/mailer` / Nodemailer)

Already SMTP-based — switching from SendGrid/Brevo to BunMail is a `.env` change only:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=mail.yourdomain.com   # your BunMail host
EMAIL_USER=apikey                # any value
EMAIL_PASSWORD=bm_live_xxxxxxxx  # a BunMail API key
EMAIL_SENDER=hello@yourdomain.com  # domain registered + DKIM-verified in BunMail
```

```ts
MailerModule.forRootAsync({
  useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => ({
    transport: {
      host: config.get("EMAIL_HOST"),
      port: 465,
      secure: true, // implicit TLS (SMTPS)
      auth: { user: config.get("EMAIL_USER"), pass: config.get("EMAIL_PASSWORD") },
    },
    defaults: { from: config.get("EMAIL_SENDER") },
  }),
});
```

### Infisical / Netbird / Dify (and most self-hosted apps)

These expose SMTP settings in their config/env. Set:

```
SMTP host      = mail.yourdomain.com   (or the BunMail container hostname)
SMTP port      = 465
SMTP username  = apikey
SMTP password  = bm_live_...
SMTP from      = notifications@yourdomain.com   (registered + DKIM-verified)
TLS            = SSL/TLS (implicit); use 587 without TLS only on a trusted private network
```

## Per-key daily quotas (#123)

Set `SMTP_SUBMISSION_DAILY_QUOTA` to cap how many messages each API key can send via the submission path per **UTC calendar day**. Once a key reaches the cap, further submissions are rejected with SMTP **`452`** (a *temporary* failure — the window resets at `00:00 UTC`, so clients retry rather than treating it as permanent). `0` (default) means unlimited.

- Counts only **accepted** messages toward the cap; rejections don't consume quota.
- Applies to the SMTP submission path **only** — the REST `POST /api/v1/emails/send` API is unaffected.
- Usage is tracked per `(api_key, UTC day)` in the `smtp_submission_usage` table (`accepted` / `rejected` counters). Every post-auth outcome is recorded, so `rejected` includes quota hits, suppressed recipients, and unregistered-domain rejections.
- The check reads the day's accepted count then sends; under high concurrency a key may exceed the cap by a small margin (soft quota).

## Stats endpoint (#123)

### `GET /api/v1/smtp-submission/stats`

Bearer-auth + rate-limited, **scoped to the calling API key** (like the rest of `/api/v1`). Returns per-day accepted/rejected counts for messages sent via the submission server, plus the key's quota status.

**Query params:** `days` (trailing UTC-day window inclusive of today; default `30`, max `365`).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "window": { "days": 30 },
    "quota": { "daily": 1000, "usedToday": 42, "remaining": 958 },
    "totals": { "accepted": 1234, "rejected": 7 },
    "daily": [
      { "day": "2026-07-18", "accepted": 40, "rejected": 1 },
      { "day": "2026-07-19", "accepted": 42, "rejected": 0 }
    ]
  }
}
```

When quotas are disabled (`SMTP_SUBMISSION_DAILY_QUOTA=0`), `quota.daily` and `quota.remaining` are `null` (not `0`, which would read as "no sends allowed"). Days with no activity are omitted from `daily`.

> Cross-key / instance-wide submission analytics (top keys, rejection-by-reason) and a dashboard view are a separate follow-up — this endpoint is per-key only.

## Service Methods

### smtp-submission.service.ts

#### `start(portOverride?: number): void`
Starts the submission server on `SMTP_SUBMISSION_PORT` (or `portOverride`, used by tests). Requires AUTH; authenticates the password against the API-keys table via `findByHash`.

#### `stop(): void`
Gracefully shuts the server down (called from the app's shutdown handler).

### usage.service.ts (#123)

#### `recordOutcome(apiKeyId, "accepted" | "rejected"): Promise<void>`
Upserts today's `(api_key, UTC day)` row and increments the matching counter atomically (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`).

#### `getAcceptedToday(apiKeyId): Promise<number>`
Today's accepted count for the key (0 if no row). Backs the quota check.

#### `getStats(apiKeyId, days): Promise<UsageStats>`
Per-day rows (oldest first) + window totals over the trailing `days` UTC days. Backs the stats endpoint.

### message-mapper.ts (pure, unit-tested)

#### `buildSubmissionInput(parts): SendEmailInput`
Turns extracted addresses + subject/body into a `SendEmailInput`: resolves the sender (From header → envelope MAIL FROM), assigns To/Cc from headers, preserves BCC (envelope recipients not in headers), and falls back to envelope recipients when no To header is present. Throws on missing sender or no recipients (mapped to SMTP `550`).

```

The SMTP listener itself has no HTTP routes — it's an alternate **ingress** to the `emails` table via `createEmail`, with SMTP status codes as its "responses". The `plugin` / `dtos` / `models` / `serializations` exist only for the usage-stats REST surface + quota table added in #123.
